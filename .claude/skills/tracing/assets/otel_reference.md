# OpenTelemetry reference for CodeEvolver tracing

This is the self-contained reference for how OTel is collected, what attributes
matter, and what the architect sees per row. It is mirrored from the relevant
sections of `specs/engine2.md`; if the two ever drift, the spec wins for engine
internals and this skill wins for client-facing instrumentation guidance.

## How OTel collection works

CodeEvolver relies on the process-global `TracerProvider`. Any code that calls
`trace.get_tracer(...)` routes spans to whatever provider is currently set.
The optimizer exploits this:

1. **Before evaluation**: `setup_tracer()` (in `src/engine/telemetry/__init__.py`)
   probes the global provider. If a real SDK `TracerProvider` is already
   installed (e.g. the client's LangFuse/Honeycomb wiring), it adds our
   `SimpleSpanProcessor` + `InMemorySpanExporter` to it — without replacing
   the existing setup. If no real provider exists, it installs one.
2. **During evaluation**: the client program runs. Any OTel-decorated
   function (LLM calls, parsers, rules, etc.) emits spans that are
   automatically collected in the in-memory exporter.
3. **After each row**: `drain_spans()` returns the row's spans and clears the
   exporter buffer so the next row gets a fresh trace.
4. **On shutdown**: `shutdown_tracer()` detaches the processor without
   destroying the provider (OTel globals are set-once per process).

No CodeEvolver imports in client code. The client uses standard OpenTelemetry:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer("my-service")

with tracer.start_as_current_span("function_name"):
    ...
```

The `@traceable` decorator in this skill is just a thin wrapper over that
exact pattern.

## What gets collected

Span attributes (set by whoever creates the span — client decorator, AI
framework instrumentor, or our `@traceable` decorator):

| Attribute             | Set by             | Purpose                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Span name             | Client / decorator | Identifies the function (e.g. `"FactChecker.parse_claim"`, `"llm.generate"`). Defaults to `fn.__qualname__` for `@traceable`. |
| Parent span ID        | OTel context propagation | Automatic — nested spans get parent-child relationships.            |
| Start / end time      | OTel SDK           | Automatic.                                                              |
| `ce.span_kind`        | Client / decorator | Classifies the span: `"llm"`, `"tool"`, `"chain"`, `"retriever"`, `"function"`. |
| `ce.inputs.*`         | Client / decorator | Function inputs as span attributes (one key per parameter).             |
| `ce.output`           | Client / decorator | Function return value as a span attribute.                              |
| `ce.error`            | Client / decorator | Exception type + message if the function threw.                         |

The `ce.*` prefix is the CodeEvolver convention. Standard OTel attributes
(`gen_ai.request.model`, etc.) are preserved in `metadata` on the trace
entry but are not required.

## Trace entry fields

The converter (`src/engine/telemetry/converter.py`) turns each span into a
trace entry dict:

| Field           | Type            | Required | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signature_key` | string          | yes      | Span name — identifies the function or module.                              |
| `span_kind`     | string          | no       | `"llm"`, `"tool"`, `"chain"`, `"retriever"`, `"function"`. Defaults to `"function"` if `ce.span_kind` is absent. Inferred to `"llm"` when any `gen_ai.*` attribute is present. |
| `parent_key`    | string or null  | no       | Name of the parent span. `null` for root-level steps. Resolved row-locally by `spans_to_trace_entries`. |
| `inputs`        | dict            | yes      | Extracted from `ce.inputs.*` span attributes. Falls back to `gen_ai.prompt` / `llm.input_messages` / `input.value` when no `ce.inputs.*` exist (so OpenInference spans still show inputs). |
| `output`        | string or dict  | yes      | From `ce.output`. OTel attributes are primitives only, so this round-trips as a string. JSON-encode structured output yourself if you need it. |
| `error`         | string or null  | no       | From `ce.error`, or from the span status if the span ended with `StatusCode.ERROR`. |
| `metadata`      | dict            | no       | Any non-`ce.*` span attributes worth preserving (e.g., `model`, `tokens.*`). |
| `start_time`    | float           | no       | Span start time in seconds since epoch (used for ordering).                 |

## JSONL trace format

`/traces/iteration_{N}_{suffix}.jsonl` — one JSON line per example:

```json
{
  "example_id": 0,
  "score": 0.85,
  "feedback": "Partially correct — wrong jurisdiction",
  "failed": false,
  "input": {"statement": "tomatoes are vegetables"},
  "output": {"verdict": "false"},
  "trace": [
    {
      "signature_key": "pipeline",
      "span_kind": "chain",
      "parent_key": null,
      "input": {"statement": "tomatoes are vegetables"},
      "output": {"verdict": "false"}
    },
    {
      "signature_key": "FactChecker.parse_claim",
      "span_kind": "tool",
      "parent_key": "pipeline",
      "inputs": {"text": "tomatoes are vegetables"},
      "output": "[\"tomatoes are vegetables\"]"
    },
    {
      "signature_key": "llm.judge",
      "span_kind": "llm",
      "parent_key": "pipeline",
      "inputs": {"prompt": "Classify whether this claim is true or false..."},
      "output": "False",
      "metadata": {"model": "gpt-4o", "tokens.input": 342, "tokens.output": 89}
    }
  ]
}
```

The `parent` / `child` suffix convention:

- `"parent"` — evaluation of the current candidate before changes
- `"child"` — evaluation after the architect's proposed changes
- `"seed"`  — initial seed full-valset eval
- `"final"` — finalization full-valset eval

CodeEvolver also writes a compact per-row index file alongside each trace file (`/traces/iteration_{N}_{suffix}_index.jsonl`) that the architect embeds inline in its prompts. That's an engine-side artifact — clients don't generate it and don't need to know its shape. See `specs/engine2.md` if you're curious.

## Wrapping an existing telemetry system

If a client has their own telemetry pipeline (e.g. a LangFuse SDK call) and wants those events to also show up in CodeEvolver traces, wrap the call in an OTel span and mirror the kwargs as attributes. Example pattern:

```python
def attach_attributes(span, data, prefix="lf"):
    for k, v in data.items():
        try:
            span.set_attribute(f"{prefix}.{k}", str(v))
        except Exception:
            span.set_attribute(f"{prefix}.{k}", "[unserializable]")

with tracer.start_as_current_span("langfuse.generation") as span:
    attach_attributes(span, kwargs)
    result = self.langfuse.generation(**kwargs)
    if isinstance(result, dict):
        attach_attributes(span, result, prefix="lf.response")
```

CodeEvolver's converter dumps non-`ce.*` attributes into the trace entry's `metadata` field, so all the mirrored LangFuse data lands there for the architect to read. The client's own LangFuse pipeline keeps shipping in parallel — `setup_tracer` does not replace it.

## Raw instrumentation pattern (without `@traceable`)

If you need something the decorator can't express (custom span name per call, conditional capture, partial output), use the raw OTel pattern directly:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def client_function(text: str):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("function_name") as span:
        span.set_attribute("ce.span_kind", "tool")
        span.set_attribute("ce.inputs.text", str(text))
        try:
            result = ...
            span.set_attribute("ce.output", str(result))
            return result
        except Exception as exc:
            span.set_attribute("ce.error", f"{type(exc).__name__}: {exc}")
            raise
```

This is what `@traceable` expands to internally. Keep `opentelemetry-api` as the only import — no CodeEvolver imports.

## Operational notes

- **Span volume.** Programs with many small functions can produce large trace files. The architect's prompts already see only the index file (full trace file is loaded via `inspect_traces`), so volume affects disk + reflection-LM context only. If a single row's trace exceeds a few hundred entries, prune by raising the threshold for what counts as "instrumentation-worthy" (see SKILL.md §"Step 3").
- **Attribute size.** `@traceable` stores inputs and outputs in full by default — the architect is expected to grep / parse large payloads itself rather than work from a truncated slice. If a single attribute genuinely needs to be capped (PII, binary blobs), pass `max_attr_chars=N` per-decoration.
- **Async programs.** OTel uses `contextvars`-based context propagation, which works correctly with `async/await` on Python 3.7+. No special handling needed — the `@traceable` decorator detects coroutine functions automatically.
- **Parent-input dedupe.** When a child span's `ce.inputs[<key>]` is ≥ 5,000 chars and exactly equal to its parent's value for the same key, the converter replaces the child's value with `"<inherited from parent span '<name>'>"`. This stops a long prompt from being repeated up a wrapper-chain in the trace JSONL — the architect still sees the prompt once on the originating span. Resolved by span_id, so siblings with the same name don't accidentally trigger. Implemented in `src/engine/telemetry/converter.py::_dedupe_inputs_against_parent`; threshold defaults to `DEDUPE_THRESHOLD = 5000`. Cost: sub-millisecond per row even at million-character inputs (CPython `==` is memcmp at C speed).

## Assumptions about client code

For the architect's traces to be useful, the client program needs:

1. **LLM calls are decorated** — Each language model query has an OTel span
   with `ce.span_kind = "llm"` and input/output attributes. This may come
   from:
   - AI framework auto-instrumentation (DSPy + OpenInference, LangChain +
     callbacks, OpenAI SDK instrumentor, etc.)
   - Manual `@traceable("llm")` or `@tracer.start_as_current_span(...)`.
2. **Key deterministic functions are decorated** — Parsers, rules,
   transformers, validators, and other pipeline functions have OTel spans
   with appropriate `ce.span_kind` values. Either present in the client
   codebase already, or added by hand / by the future tracing agent.
3. **Parent-child relationships are natural** — OTel's context propagation
   handles this automatically. If `pipeline()` calls `parse()` which calls
   `validate()`, and all three are decorated, the span tree is
   `pipeline → parse → validate`. No manual wiring.

## DSPy + OpenInference

For DSPy clients, install `openinference-instrumentation-dspy` and call
`DSPyInstrumentor().instrument()` once at module import. That wraps DSPy's
`Predict` / `ChainOfThought` / `ReAct` etc. to emit OTel spans with
`llm.input_messages` / `input.value` / `output.value` attributes. The
converter's framework fallback promotes those into the standard
trace-entry shape automatically — no `@traceable` needed on DSPy modules
themselves, only on the surrounding deterministic code.

The DSPy span filter (`src/engine/telemetry/filters/ai_frameworks/dspy.py`)
drops the structural plumbing wrappers (`ChainOfThought.forward`,
`Predict.forward`, `ChatAdapter.__call__/format/parse`, `Predict(...)`)
because they carry duplicated inputs/outputs of the leaf `LM.__call__`.
LM calls, TOOL/RETRIEVER spans, and the user's own `dspy.Module.forward`
spans are retained.

## Span filters

`telemetry/filters/__init__.py` exposes `make_keep_predicate(drops)` which
composes the framework-agnostic `KEEP_KINDS` set (OpenInference standard:
`LLM`, `TOOL`, `RETRIEVER`, `RERANKER`, `EMBEDDING`, `AGENT`) with
per-framework `should_drop(span)` predicates. Anything in `KEEP_KINDS`
is always kept. Anything else is kept unless a drop predicate claims it.

The evaluator wires this in at `src/engine/evaluator/mounted/evaluate.py`:
`setup_tracer(span_filter=make_keep_predicate([dspy_filter.should_drop]))`.
New framework filters live alongside `dspy.py` and are appended to the
list without touching the core telemetry module.
